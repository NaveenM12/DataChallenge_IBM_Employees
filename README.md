Analyzing IBM Employees and Attrition
Naveen Mirapuri

This report will analyze survey data gathered from employees across IBM to gain a clearer image about the community within the company, while also striving to better understand employee attrition and potential causes. Using information from 1,470 employees, the following will first breakdown different groups of IBM workers. These groups will serve as the foundation for dissecting the makeup of the company workforce and also provide important data to be used when analyzing important company topics such as diversity and overall satisfaction. We will end up using these groups to develop a model that predicts attrition within IBM employees and can identify the most important contributing variables. With this information, the conclusion contains a final plan for IBMâ€™s HR team on areas of future focus and improvement.
